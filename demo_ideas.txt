LED cube visualizations (in no particular order)
================================================

a spiral, but in the style of the data snake
fireplace
plasma
platformer
minesweeper

use the wifi somehow
	allow people to remotely change the demos via the internet / over the local network
	scroll tweets
	visualize the weather (AKA fully commit to becoming a weather cube)

trace a 3d path similar to https://youtu.be/6mXM-oGggrM?t=2m50s
	the hue can change over time to it's easier to see the path
	the path should be aprox smooth (maybe just like add a random velocity every tick and have it move according to acceleration or something)
	(also take care not to go beyond walls)

temperature sensor visualized

guitar hero

slide symbols in
	arbitrary text (ex. "hello world", letter by letter)
	heart, peace, anchor, down arrow, dollar sign, raindrop, crown, star, horseshoe, crescent moon, diamond, plus, O

show image when the cube is looked at from a certain angle
	use processing sketch to provide webcam feed?

infinite texture to drive on using perlin noise on each color channel
	ultrasonic sensor gas pedal
	this but with no car and it's always moving (but the noise is height instead of just color)

make display show current amp draw
make cube show current amp draw
	change color of each LED by how much current it used over time
graph the ram requirements of different neopixel strips sizes for the sake of finding out if  we have enough ram

use ultrasonic sensor to slice down through volumetric object

anti-aliasing (but actually it's just edge smoothing)


color tests
	make x edge red, make y (vertical) edge green, make z edge blue
	make x axis be r intensity, y be g intensity, and z be b intensity
		also but with HSV
	make the ground plane be a hue circle and the gravity axis be saturation/brightness (brighter on bottom) (and rotate the hue circle about the gravity axis)
	rainbow from one corner to the opposite corner

draw an earth

3D tetris
	make 2x2x2 region be a single block

clock

fireworks

pulsing pink heart

bouncingballs.ino, but with a single LED light moving around, bouncing off the walls in 3d

A helix where only the two points on the outer edges of the helix are lit

Droplets falling and causing ripples when they hit the bottom
