LED cube visualizations (in no particular order)
================================================

temperature sensor visualized

guitar hero

3d snake

slide symbols in
	arbitrary text (ex. "hello world", letter by letter)
	heart, peace, anchor, down arrow, dollar sign, raindrop, crown, star, horseshoe, crescent moon, diamond, plus, O

show image when the cube is looked at from a certain angle
	use processing sketch to provide webcam feed?

infinite texture to drive on using perlin noise on each color channel
	ultrasonic sensor gas pedal
	this but with no car and it's always moving (but the noise is height instead of just color)

make display show current amp draw
make cube show current amp draw
	change color of each LED by how much current it used over time
graph the ram requirements of different neopixel strips sizes for the sake of finding out if  we have enough ram

fireplace

use ultrasonic sensor to slice down through volumetric object

anti-aliasing (but actually it's just edge smoothing)


color tests
	make x edge red, make y (vertical) edge green, make z edge blue
	make x axis be r intensity, y be g intensity, and z be b intensity
		also but with HSV
	make the ground plane be a hue circle and the gravity axis be saturation/brightness (brighter on bottom) (and rotate the hue circle about the gravity axis)
	rainbow from one corner to the opposite corner

make a sphere
	draw a sphere, that's the earth

3D tetris
	make 2x2x2 region be a single block

clock

fireworks

pulsing pink heart

bouncingballs.ino, but with a single LED light moving around, bouncing off the walls in 3d

spectrum analyzer
	make each row an octave

3D function plotter
4D function plotter - using hue
5D function plotter - using time

falling "raindrops" OR Enter the Matrix falling green things kinda thing

random pastel colors with some off

wandering dot project, but in 3d
